"""
Comprehensive Report Generation Module for WebAssembly Performance Analysis.

This module serves as the primary interface for generating analysis reports that combine
statistical analysis, quality assessment, and decision recommendations for WebAssembly
language selection. The design follows a layered architecture where:

1. Data Collection Layer: Validates and aggregates benchmark data
2. Analysis Layer: Performs statistical comparisons and effect size calculations
3. Quality Layer: Assesses data reliability and confidence thresholds
4. Decision Layer: Generates actionable recommendations with confidence indicators
5. Presentation Layer: Formats results for engineering consumption

PUBLIC INTERFACE:
- generate_report(): Main entry point for comprehensive analysis reports

DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
- Single responsibility: Each private method handles one aspect of report generation
- Fail-fast validation: Early detection of data quality issues
- Confidence-driven recommendations: Clear uncertainty communication
- Engineering-focused: Practical guidance over statistical jargon
