# WebAssembly Performance Analysis Report

*This report will be generated automatically by the analysis scripts*

## Executive Summary

[To be populated with key findings from the statistical analysis]

## Methodology

### Benchmark Tasks
1. **Mandelbrot Set** - CPU-intensive floating point computation
2. **Array Sort** - Integer sorting with memory allocation pressure  
3. **Base64 Encoding/Decoding** - Byte processing and string manipulation
4. **JSON Parsing** - Structured data processing with object allocation
5. **Matrix Multiplication** - Dense numerical computation

### Test Scales
- **Small**: Minimal memory allocation (~1MB) - baseline performance
- **Medium**: Moderate allocation (~3MB) - light GC pressure
- **Large**: Heavy allocation (~8MB) - significant GC impact

### Statistical Analysis
- Descriptive statistics (mean, std, confidence intervals)
- Normality testing (Shapiro-Wilk)
- Significance testing (t-test or Mann-Whitney U)
- Multiple comparison correction (Benjamini-Hochberg FDR)
- Effect size analysis (Cohen's d)
